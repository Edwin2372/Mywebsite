                    The rapper Jay-Z & his attorney have reported an extortion case against attorney Tony Buzbee. The case arises from the claims by Buzbee’s client, who reported that the music superstar sexually molested her at an afterparty following 2000 MTV VMAs when the girl was 13.<br>
                    
                    The legal team of Jay-Z, led by the attorney Alex Spiro, has firmly rejected the accusations. Spiro claimed that Buzbee told him that his client was a pedophile who had assaulted male and female children multiple times, and it was a strategy to blackmail him into paying a settlement. He named these accusations as the “weapon in a plot designed to destroy Hov’s reputation for financial gain.”<br>
                    
                    All this comes after Buzbee had earlier modified a previous lawsuit that he had filed against Sean “Diddy” Combs, adding Jay-Z to it. In response, Jay-Z tweeted from his X (previously Twitter) page that Buzbee had attempted to extort him. What he had figured out was the nature of these accusations, and the media would put me under so much pressure to settle. “No sir, it had the complete opposite effect!!!” Jay-Z said. ”It made me all the more eager to expose you as a fraud in the most open manner possible. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!! ”</p>

                    Denzel Washington has revealed he called director Ryan Coogler to apologize after revealing his involvement in the third Black Panther film before official confirmation.<br>
                    
                    The 69-year-old veteran disclosed last month that he would join the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) blockbuster, one of his final projects before retirement. During Variety’s Awards Circuit Podcast, Denzel Washington admitted, “Ryan’s a genius. I called him and apologized for talking about the movie, and right there sitting with him was his beautiful wife. He’s still Ryan—humble and full of ideas. Whatever he writes, I’ll read.”<br>
                    
                    The new film follows Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) and the original Black Panther (2018). Denzel Washington, reflecting on his career spanning four decades, noted he has just a few projects left. Speaking to Australia’s Today show, he said: “At this point, I’m only interested in working with the best. I don’t know how many more films I’ll make—probably not that many. I want to do things I haven’t done.”<br>
                    
                    Denzel Washington teased upcoming roles, saying, “I played Othello at 22; I’m now going to play it at 70. After that, I’m playing Hannibal and talking with Steve McQueen about a film. Then, Ryan Coogler is writing a part for me in the next Black Panther. After that, I’ll do King Lear, and then I’ll retire.”<br>
                    
                    Washington also confirmed plans to star in The Equalizer 4 and 5, continuing his successful action franchise. In Esquire, he explained, “I told them I’d do another Equalizer, and we’re doing four and five. More people are happy about that—people love those doggone Equalizers.” He added that the films resonate with audiences: “They want me to go get the bad guys. I say, ‘Okay, I’ll get them! Just wait right there.”</p>

                <p>Chart-topping rapper Ice Spice, known for her hits and style, recently clapped back at the haters who criticized her body transformation. The reaction sparked after the rapper posted pictures showing her toned physique. Of course, all of her followers weren’t too pleased with it. “I liked you when you were bigger,” one follower commented. But Ice Spice shut down hate with humor.<br>

                    She posted a meme of an unflattering SpongeBob SquarePants with the caption, “nah she mid bro,” making it clear she’s unbothered by detractors.<br>
                    
                    It didn’t happen overnight. TMZ reports that Spice has been working on getting fit through regular gym sessions, clean eating, and a busy tour schedule. Last month alone, she shared a video of her first pull-up, a milestone she proudly celebrated. This comes after she turned heads by gracing the runway at the prestigious Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. ​<br>
                    
                    Amid her transformation, Ice Spice was also rumored to be taking a weight-shedding medicament, Ozempic. She later came to refute the issue, protesting, “What even is Ozempic? What the f*** is that?” Her statement pointedly assured her hard work and approach toward the natural method did the work.</p>

                    Born Beatrice Akuvi Hosen Kumordzie, the skilled songstress grew up in a home where art conveys via dance and music. Having roots from ‘the Gold Coast’ – Ghana, she became familiar with African music and its components. A few years after, Kumordzie moved to South Africa‘s Cape Town, where she underwent several musical elements with native songsters.  In 2019, Beatrice debuted with her ‘Free Me From Me’ song with Algerian composer Kechou.<br>

                <p>Six years after ‘Shikantaza,’ Chinese Man returns with a new single, “We’ve Been Here Before,” the first extract from their eponymous album scheduled for March 2024. Initially, on this track, only the voices and words of Tumi (Stogie T), a South African MC with whom the group had previously collaborated, and Isadora, a Belgian singer who had worked with Matteo on a solo project, were supposed to appear on this track. But in music, as in life, beautiful accidents happen.<br>

                    Miscellaneous, present for the initial listens of the song, spontaneously added his voice and mumbled what would become the catchy chorus… Déja-vu… thereby crystallizing the critical themes of the album. From a simple, unexpected hum, the identity of the single was born, blending Tumi’s very hip-hop and poetic delivery and phrasing with the trip-hop influence brought by Isadora’s voice.</p>

                <h1>Rolex stolen from Keanu Reeves’ LA home turns up in Chile</h1>
                <img src="celebnews images/2.3.webp" alt="News Image">
                
                <p>
                    Police in Chile say they have recovered three watches belonging to “John Wick” star Keanu Reeves – including a $9,000 Rolex – that are thought to have been stolen from the actor’s Los Angeles home in late 2023.
                    
                    The Rolex Submariner watch – engraved with the actor’s first name and the words, “2021, JW4, thank you, The John Wick Five” – was recovered Saturday in eastern Santiago during a police operation linked to a series of local robberies.
                    
                    In 2021, Reeves reportedly gifted Rolex Submariners to the stuntmen he worked with on “John Wick: Chapter 4.”
                    
                    The watch has a price of around $9,000, according to Rolex’s website.
                    
                    Ironically, the “John Wick” saga starts with Reeves’ character – a former hitman – seeking revenge after his home is broken into, robbed and his dog killed.
                    
                    Chilean authorities said they had found jewelry and “valuable” watches during raids on four houses, with at least one of the timepieces “belonging to a famous actor who was victim of a robbery in Los Angeles in December 2023.”
                    
                    CNN Chile, citing local police, reported that a total of three watches recovered in the raids belong to the actor. It said Chilean authorities were working with US officials on the case and that this had helped them link the watch to the 2023 burglary at the actor’s home.
                    
                    Police said they have arrested a 21-year-old man.
                    
                    CNN has reached out to Reeves’ representatives for comment.
                    
                    The actor has been the victim of home robberies several times. In 2014, his home was reportedly invaded twice in three days.</p>

                <img src="celebnews images/2.4.webp" alt="News Image">
                
                <p>There’s no place like home… to watch the “Wicked” movie.

                    Universal Pictures, the studio behind the hit film, announced on Thursday that “Wicked” will be available to buy or rent on December 31 on digital streaming platforms including Prime Video and Apple TV.
                    
                    The streaming release will also include a plethora of bonus content, including a sing-along version of the film, behind-the-scenes featurettes, commentary from director Jon M. Chu and the film’s stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, plus several deleted and extended scenes, according to a news release.
                    
                    Among the bonus content is a 40-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that “celebrates the film’s transformative on-screen magic,” and bonus clips that will give viewers a look at the special effects that brought the large-scale sets to life.
                    
                    “Wicked” stars Erivo, Grande, Jeff Goldblum, Bowen Yang, Peter Dinklage, Marissa Bode, “Bridgerton” star Jonathan Bailey and Oscar-winner Michelle Yeoh.
                    
                    The nearly three-hour-long epic is the first installment of Chu’s two-part cinematic adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical that recounts events in the magical land of Oz that occurred before Dorothy’s arrival. The musical, which opened on Broadway in 2003, was itself adapted from Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch.”
                    
                    The movie premiered in theaters on November 22 and has raked in over $580 million at the global box office to date, also nabbing the third highest-grossing opening weekend of 2024 behind “Deadpool & Wolverine” and “Inside Out 2.”
                    
                    “Wicked” has been nominated for four Golden Globes including best motion picture – musical or comedy, and recognition in lead and supporting acting categories for Erivo and Grande, respectively.
                    
                    The second installment will be titled “Wicked: For Good,” in a nod to one of the original musical’s popular songs, and will premiere in theaters on November 21, 2025.</p>

                    After a year filled with animated inner emotions, mutants, aliens, gladiators and witches, the new year will bring a crop of new (or, newly revisited) movies to choose from, as always.
                    
                    Many upcoming films are sequels, reboots and franchise extensions, which can be chalked up to Hollywood’s penchant for playing it safe with known properties, but it’s also a testament to our collective desire to see where things go next for some of our most beloved characters and worlds.
                    
                    While by no means exhaustive, here is a collection of some of the big movies to look out for in 2025:

                <img src="celebnews images/1.1.jpg" alt="News Image">
                
                <p>This month, Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Jay-Z, alongside music mogul Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, are being accused in a civil lawsuit. The claim involves raping a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party in 2000. Jay-Z vehemently denied the allegations, calling them a blackmail attempt.<br>
                    Responding publicly on social media to the plaintiff’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, Jay-Z wrote, “No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!” Diddy’s legal team similarly rejected the claims, describing them as another fabrication in a long line of unfounded allegations against him.</p>
